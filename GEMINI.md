# Directory Overview

This directory appears to be a personal knowledge base and a "work in progress" (WIP) space. It functions as a central hub for organizing personal and professional tasks, research, notes, and links. The structure is fluid and seems to be organized around different contexts or projects. It does not appear to be a software project.

# Key Files

*   `README.md`: This is the main entry point and acts as a "brain dump" of current tasks, ideas, and links. It contains a mix of to-do lists (WIPs), links to technical resources, personal notes, and contact information.

*   `docs/`: This directory contains more structured notes and research on various topics, including business and media.

*   `trink/`: This directory appears to be another area for personal notes, as indicated by the `trinknotes202509.md` file.

*   `usd/`: This directory is described as "paused" in the main README, suggesting it's a placeholder for a future or past project.

# Usage

This directory is used for personal knowledge management and task tracking. It is not a software project with build scripts or source code. The primary use case seems to be for the owner to keep track of a wide range of information in a single, centralized location.
