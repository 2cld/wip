I'm a auto mechanic repairing a 2010 Buick LaCrosse.  I get the following codes:

```
P0014-00 Exhaust Camshaft Position System Performance Bank 1 Current
P0017-00 Crankshaft Position - Exhaust Camshaft Position Not Plausible Bank 1 Current
P0300-00 Engine Misfire Detected Not Run
P0420-00 Catalyst System Low Efficiency Bank 1 Not Run
P0430-00 Catalyst System Low Efficiency Bank 2 Not Run
P0442-00 Evaporative Emission (EVAP) System Small Leak Detected Not Run
P0451-00 Fuel Tank Pressure Sensor Performance Not Run
P0454-00 Fuel Tank Pressure Sensor Circuit Intermittent Not Run
P0464-00 Fuel Level Sensor Circuit Intermittent Not Run
P050D-00 Cold Start Rough Idle Not Run
P162B-00 Remote Vehicle Speed Limiting Signal Message Counter Incorrect Not Run
P2135-00 Throttle Position Sensors 1-2 Not Plausible Current
```

- This combination of codes on a 2010 Buick LaCrosse indicates two distinct major issues: a mechanical timing failure (P0014, P0017) and a likely electrical/circuitry failure affecting the fuel and EVAP sensors (P0451, P0454, P0464).

1. Timing and Performance Issues (P0014, P0017, P0300)
These codes focus on Bank 1 (the firewall side on the 3.0L/3.6L V6).
Stretched Timing Chains: The P0017 (Crank/Cam correlation) paired with P0014 is a classic sign of stretched timing chains, a frequent failure point for this GM engine platform.
VVT Solenoid Failure: P0014 specifically indicates the exhaust camshaft is over-advanced. Before condemning the chains, inspect the Bank 1 Exhaust Variable Valve Timing (VVT) Solenoid for sludge or electrical failure.
Oil Quality: Low oil level or dirty oil can prevent the VVT solenoids from controlling the cam phasers correctly, triggering these codes. 

2. Sensor Circuit & EVAP Issues (P0451, P0454, P0464, P162B)
The fact that you have "Intermittent" or "Performance" codes for the Fuel Tank Pressure Sensor, Fuel Level Sensor, and Speed Limiting signal suggests a shared electrical fault.
Wiring Harness Rub: Check the wiring harness near the rear of the engine or where it runs toward the fuel tank. A rubbed-through harness can short the 5V reference circuit shared by these sensors.
5V Reference Circuit: If one sensor (like the Fuel Tank Pressure sensor) shorts internally, it can pull down the entire 5V reference line, causing multiple unrelated sensor codes (P0451, P0454, P2135). 

3. Throttle & Idle Issues (P2135, P050D)
Throttle Body: P2135 indicates a voltage correlation issue between Throttle Position Sensors 1 and 2. This often puts the car in "Reduced Engine Power" mode. Inspect the throttle body connector for corrosion or broken wires.
Rough Cold Start: P050D is usually a secondary symptom of the timing issues or the throttle body fault mentioned above. 

4. Catalyst Efficiency (P0420, P0430)
Clogged Converters: These codes mean the catalytic converters are no longer cleaning the exhaust efficiently. On high-mileage LaCrosse models, persistent misfires (P0300) or rich conditions from timing issues often destroy the catalysts. 

## Recommended Diagnostic Steps
- Check Oil: Verify the oil level and condition immediately.
- Verify 5V Reference: Use a multimeter or scan tool to check the 5V reference circuit. If it is unstable, unplug the Fuel Tank Pressure Sensor (located on top of the fuel tank) or the Throttle Body to see if the voltage stabilizes and other "intermittent" codes clear.
- Command VVT Solenoids: Use a bidirectional scan tool to command the Bank 1 Exhaust VVT solenoid. If the engine doesn't stumble or the cam angle doesn't change, the solenoid or the phaser is likely faulty.
- Inspect Chains: If VVT solenoids are clean and functional but P0017 persists, the timing chains likely require replacement.
