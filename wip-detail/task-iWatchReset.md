To "reset and transfer" your Apple Watch to a family member, the most important step is to **unpair** it from your iPhone. This does two things at once: it wipes your data and, crucially, removes the **Activation Lock**, which allows the new owner to set it up as their own.

Here is the step-by-step process:

### 1. Unpair and Erase (Best Method)

This method ensures the watch is completely detached from your Apple Account.

* Keep your Apple Watch and iPhone **close together**.
* Open the **Watch app** on your iPhone and go to the **My Watch** tab.
* Tap **All Watches** at the top left.
* Tap the **Info (i)** button next to the watch you want to give away.
* Tap **Unpair Apple Watch**.
* **For Cellular models:** Choose to remove your cellular plan (you may also need to contact your carrier to cancel the subscription).
* Enter your **Apple Account password** to disable Activation Lock and tap **Unpair** again to confirm.

> **Note:** Your iPhone will automatically create a backup of your watch before erasing it, just in case you need that data for a future watch.

### 2. If You Already Gave the Watch Away

If the watch is no longer with you, you can still remove the lock remotely so the family member can use it:

* Go to [iCloud.com](https://www.icloud.com/find) and sign in with your Apple Account.
* Go to **Find My**, select **All Devices**, and click on your Apple Watch.
* Click **Erase Apple Watch**, then click the **(X)** or **Remove from Account** once it is erased.

### 3. Cleaning and Preparation

Before handing it over, it's a "pro-peer" move to:

* **Clean it:** Use a non-abrasive, lint-free cloth to wipe the casing and sensors.
* **Gather the gear:** Make sure to include the **magnetic charging cable**, as older watches require specific chargers that the family member might not have.

### 4. Setting It Up for the New Owner

The family member can now hold the watch near their iPhone to begin the standard setup. If they don't have their own iPhone (e.g., a child or elderly relative), you can use **[Family Setup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109015)** to manage the watch from your own iPhone while giving them their own phone number and account.
