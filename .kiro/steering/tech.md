# Technology Stack

## Build System
This repository uses standard markdown documentation with no build process required. All files are plain text markdown that can be edited directly.

## Tech Stack
- **Documentation**: Markdown (.md files)
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub hosting
- **Project Management**: File-based task tracking system
- **External Integrations**: 
  - Google Drive for business documents
  - Google Calendar integration (planned)
  - GitHub Pages hosting (CNAME file present)

## Common Commands
Since this is a documentation-only repository, common operations are file-based:

### File Operations

# View current tasks
cat tasks.md

# Edit main inbox
vim README.md

# Check project structure
ls -la docs/
ls -la wip-detail/
```

### Git Operations

# Standard git workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Update tasks and documentation"
git push origin main
```
